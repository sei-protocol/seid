Sei Network is the first orderbook-specific L1 blockchain. The chain emphasizes reliability, security and high throughput above all else, enabling an entirely new echelon of ultra-high performance DeFi products built on top. Sei's on-chain CLOB and matching engine provides deep liquidity and price-time-priority matching for traders and apps. Apps built on Sei benefit from built-in orderbook infrastructure, deep liquidity, and a fully decentralized matching service. Users benefit from this exchange model with the ability to select price, size, and direction of their trades coupled with MEV protection.

# seichain
**seichain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. It is built using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint core, and features a built-in central limit orderbook (CLOB) module. Decentralized applications building on Sei can build on top of the CLOB, and other Cosmos-based blockchains can leverage Sei's CLOB as a shared liquidity hub and create markets for any asset. Sei Shared Liquidity Model

Designed with developers and users in mind, Sei serves as the infrastructure and shared liquidity hub for the next generation of DeFi. Apps can easily plug-and-play to trade on Sei orderbook infrastructure and access pooled liquidity from other apps. To prioritize developer experience, Sei Network has integrated the wasmd module to support CosmWasm smart contracts.
